# AR E-commerce Platform

## Introduction
Welcome to the AR E-commerce Platform project. This application combines augmented reality with an e-commerce environment to provide users with an interactive shopping experience. Users can view products in 3D within their own space, customize them, and share their experiences on social media platforms. This README outlines the steps required to set up and run both the frontend and the backend components of the project.

## Getting Started
In this project, I used React.hs, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. Make sure you have these installed before proceeding to any of the next steps.

## Frontend

To get my front-end running, run the following:

```
cd ar-ecommerce-project
npm install
```

After all installs are done, you can start by running

```
npm start
```

## Backend

To get the backend working properly, run the following

```
node ./server.js
```

## Permissions

Since this is an AR project, the website will ask you for camera permissions. Select `allow`.
