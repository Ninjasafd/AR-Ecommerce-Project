# Interactive AR Advertising with Social Media Integration

## Background
The advertising industry is rapidly evolving with the integration of augmented reality (AR), offering immersive experiences that engage consumers in novel ways. However, there is still untapped potential in combining AR with social media to create a more interactive and shareable advertising experience. This project aims to explore this intersection, leveraging the viral nature of social media to enhance the reach and impact of AR advertisements, particularly in the context of e-commerce.

## Objective
To develop a web-based AR application that revolutionizes e-commerce advertising by enabling users to interact with products in a virtual space and share their experiences on social media. This project seeks to create a more engaging and social shopping experience, ultimately driving brand visibility and consumer engagement.

## Technology
- **AR Platform:** AR.js with A-Frame (web-based AR)
- **Social Media APIs:** Facebook/Instagram API (considering TikTok or other e-commerce platforms for integration)

## Technical Details
The application will be developed using AR.js and A-Frame for AR functionality, with 3D models created in Unity (may change because it's weird on my computer). Social media integration will be done using the above APIs, allowing for sharing across users and platforms. Depending on progress, I may build a backend based on Node.js and MongoDB, which can manage user data for metrics/analysis.

## User Experience
Users initiate the AR experience by clicking a link. They can then interact with virtual products, exploring features and customization options. After the interaction, users are prompted to share their experience on social media, further enhancing brand exposure and engagement. I may also track other metrics that measure engagement, such as time spent looking on a page, clicks or rotations of a model, and
